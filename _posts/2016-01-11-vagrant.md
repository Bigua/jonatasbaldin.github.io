Vagrant is a tool used to create local development environments as quickly as possible, helping eliminate the "works on my machine" bug. It's also great to test configuration management code, like Ansible and Puppet. You can read more about it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

In this post, I want to describe the minor tweaks I make to create an Oracle Solaris 11.2 Vagrant box, following as base the instructions in this [Engine Yard blog post](https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/building-a-vagrant-box).

First of all, I did this because the only Solaris 11 box at [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com) (Vagrant's best box repository) is broken, leaving with no option but to create my own. If you want to test it right now, just grab a terminal and type this:
{% highlight bash %}
vagrant init jonatasbaldin/solaris11
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
{% endhighlight %}

This will download the box, create a Vagrant file, power up the VM and log into it.

### Minor Tweaks ###
In Solaris, the default home user folder is `/export/home/%u`. So, the Vagrant's unsecure key should go there. <br />     
VirtualBox Guest Additions was installed manually, following [the documentation](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp46608644145200). <br /> <br />
During the package process, Vagrant did not like the `sed` binary from Oracle (it has no -i flag, responsible for edit files in place). To fix this, I created a new $PATH entry in both root and vagrant `.profile` user file, putting the GNU binaries before, as follows:
{% highlight bash %}
PATH=/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
{% endhighlight %}

And this is it. After packing and uploading to Atlas, we now have a working Oracle Solaris 11 box ready to use.
