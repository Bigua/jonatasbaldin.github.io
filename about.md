Hi there! I'm **Jonatas Baldin** and this is my personal space to share what I'm doing and what I want to do.

I'm 22 years old (now I need to remember updating this every year...). I was born in Brazil and live here since. I chose to write primarily in English because I can reach a lot more than Brazilian Portuguese.

I was a infrastructure focused guy until August/2016, but as life is a surprise box, now I'm a full-time software developer! (who would imagine?). I'm working at [Cheesecake Labs](https://ckl.io) as a Python developer, mainly Django stuff.

Besides working, I also **love** events and meetups. I'm a member of almost every meetup hosted in my city – Florianópolis – and an organizer at [Python Floripa](https://www.facebook.com/groups/python.floripa/events/), [DevOps Florianópolis](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Florianopolis/), [Code in the Dark Florianópolis](http://floripa.codeinthedark.com.br/).

You can reach me at [Twitter]({{ site.author.twitter }}), [Github]({{ site.author.github }}) or [Email](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I hope you really enjoy the reading, and if have any feedback, do not hesitate to shout it at me!

So long, and thanks for all the fish!
