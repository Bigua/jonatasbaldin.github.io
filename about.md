Hi there! I'm **Jonatas Baldin** and this is my personal space to share what I'm doing and what I want to do.

I'm 21 years old (now I need to remeber updating this every year...). I was born in Brazil and live here since. I chose to write primally in english beacuse I can reach a lot more than Brazilian Portuguese. Thus, if you work in the technology field and don't understande english, I highly recommend to start studiyng this right now.

Right now, these are the things I'm working on and trying to reach:

* Working as a Datacenter Analyst, but trying to move more and more into development field. The goal is a Full Stack Dev, because you know, [coding is a must](http://deployeveryday.com/2015/06/04/hey-sysadmin-start-coding.html).
* Trying to talk at conferences. [FLISOL 2016](https://doity.com.br/flisolcascavel2016) will be the first one!
* Inspired by startup field and learning how to do it. At the end of 2016, I really want to have at least one profitable business.
* Live in plenitude. Get better at focus, study, experiences, people skills. Like Rob Nelson said, a [Full Stack Human](http://rnelson0.com/2016/01/10/a-full-stack-what/).

You can reach me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vuashhhh), [Github](https://github.com/jonatasbaldin) or [Email](mailto:jonatas.baldin@gmail.com).

I hope you really enjoy the reading, and if have any feedback, do not hesitate to shout it at me!

So long, and thanks for all the fish!
