Hi, I'm **Jonatas B.** and I'm a system administrator. This blog, is the way I wanna share my day-a-day adventures in technology. From the Ops School perspective, I fit in the [Generalist Operations Engineer](http://www.opsschool.org/en/latest/careers.html#generalized-career-paths), dealing with almost everything listed there.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vuashhhh) and see my projects on [Github](https://github.com/jonatasbaldin). Also, for professional contact, see my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=248163136) page.

I hope you enjoy the reading!

**TODO:** Improve this about page.
